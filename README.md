# Twittter
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

### Functionality

This is the [Twitter Clone Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication) project, where I follow along to create the mechanics and styling of a simple Twitter clone.

### Thoughts

This was such a cool project to work on. After so much reading about Rails, it felt like it was really coming together here. It was an easy one, of course, because it just consisted of following step-by-step directions in [the tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=5gUysPm64a4&feature=emb_logo) - but nonetheless, it was very satisfying to see it come together. I was also impressed by how much Rails handles automatically. This was also my first time working with a CSS framework like Bulma, and because I'm not a huge fan of manually creating the visuals for websites, it was a game-changer to see how good it can look by simply adding a few classes. In the future, I'd like to spend more time learning Bulma so I can easily pull it out for some nice-looking views in my web apps.

God bless.
